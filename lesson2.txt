What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    You specify a place to store the files or data of your project, so you have set up an specific repository.
    
How is the staging area different from the working repository and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    It's like a room where you prepare the files before commiting, these files is
    what will go in our next commit. I think it lets us preview what are we modifying       before an actual commit is done.
